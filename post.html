					<p>It's the first day of D23 Expo. Excitedly and yet nervously, we went to the Anaheim
					Convention Center at around 7:30am to wait in line for the Disney Legends Ceremony,
					which wouldn't start until 10:30am. Of course we've heard about the frantic lines
					at the expo, so we were prepared and also expecting the worst. Luckily, with D23's
					new online reservation, we were able to get into the venue on time.</p>

					<p>Christina Aguilera opened the ceremony with the performance of Mulan's "Reflection".
					Robert Downey Jr. was the first to be presented the award, and almost the entire
					stood up and cheered for him. We also saw Jon Favreau, he seemed a bit nervous so
					he kind of stuttered (aw). Hans Zimmer couldn't make it or it'd have been pretty
					cool to see him in person too.</p>   

					<p>After the cremony we went to the main show floor and were completely overwhelmed
					by the people and the booths everywhere (yes, we're totally noobs). We wandered
					around mindlessly but eventually decided to visit the Disney/Pixar animation
					booth and its Onward and Frozen display.</p>

					<p>The always-crowded Marvel booth had a giveaway, and I ended up winning an Ant-Man
					Funko Pop!! NICE! Felt super lucky although I'm not that crazy about Marvel. Guess
					I'll give it to my sis.</p>

					<p>We also held a reservation for the Disney on Broadway in Concert: a 25th Anniversary
					Celebration later that day. Some of the biggest Disney Broadway stars showed up,
					so it was a grand celebration never seen before.</p>

					<p>First day at the expo actually went a lot better than expected, the only thing that sucks
					was that all the giveaways require reservation (which ran out super fast and we did not get
					any). So I didn't get the Pixar beach ball that I really wanted, bummer. Well, that's okay!
					I'm still pretty excited for the rest of the expo. I'll keep you guys updated so stay 
					tuned!</p>

					<p>Let me just end the post with a quote from our beloved Mr. Walt Disney:</p>
